Scripts for Jia et al (2023). Intergrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal the potential regulatory mechanism of unique dihydroxy fatty acid biosynthesis in the seeds of an industrial oilseed crop Orychophragmus violaceus. BMC genomics accepted
Scripts are as follow:
1-RNA_mapping - Snakemake pipeline for mapping RNA, including fastp trimming, hisat2 mapping, htseq alignment and manual calculate the fpkm and tpm values for each gene
2-Overview.R - Script to perform heatmap, PCA, HCA analysis of metabolites and genes expression
3-Kmeans_cluster.R - Script to perfrom kmeans-based cluster method using ClusterGVis package
4-pathway_identification_pheatmap.R - Script to identify the structrual genes of di-OH FA associated pathway and their corresponding expression heatmap
5-TF-SG_regulatory_networks.R - Script to construct TF-SG regulatory network
